## Why calculus?
---

Calculus is a way of solving complicated problems: _"Divide the problem into little parts (differentiation), solve problem for each little part, which is easier, then assemble the parts to solve the complex problem (integration)."_

We start the discussionn with _differential_ calculus, followed by _integral_ calculus. But before we do this, let us give an example of how the strategy of dividing and assembling can solve a problem.


### Example
---

We know that the circumference of a circle of radius $r$ is $2\pi r$. Use this information to infer the area of a circle of radius $r$. _Hint: divide the circle into smaller and smaller segments, which you arrange in a clever way._

It was Archimedes who determined the area of a circle using this method.

### Example

Johann Kepler (1571 - 1630) studied the motion of our planets. He found that each planet moves along an ellipse around the sun, but with varying speed - the closer to the sun, the higher was the speed of the planet. But according to what rule did the speed change? Kepler found that a planet moves such that it covers _an equal area_ any given time interval.

In order to find this law, he had to determine the area bounded by _curved lines_. Using a similar method as above, he divided the shaded region in small sections (which he approximated with triangles) and summed the triangle areas to find the total area.
