## Tangents

Consider a smooth curve and a point $A$ on this curve. The tangent to this curve at point $A$ is the straight line that _touches but does not cross_ the curve at $A$. But note that the straight line is allowed to cross the curve anywhere else. 

Note that the equation of a tangent is a linear function $t(x)=ax+b$.

### Exercise
---
1. Consider the unit circle. Point $A$ is on this circle at radius $30^\circ$. Determine the equation of the tangent to the circle at $A$.

2. Consider the graph of the function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$. Point $A(2\vert \sqrt{2})$ is on the graph. Determine as _precise as possible_ the slope of the tangent to the graph at $A$.
