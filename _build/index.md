Vectors represent arrows and are important for describing simple geometrical objects in a three dimensional space, such as lines, planes, or spheres. This in turn can be used to calculate shadows and reflections for photo-realistic sceneries in games and the like ("ray tracing").

In physics, vectors are used to describe fundamental properties such as speeds or forces, or anything else whose description requires a "direction" and a "length". 

Interestingly, the concept of vectors can be applied to spaces of any dimension, not just three. Statistics and Fourieranalysis, for example, make use of such concepts.
