Vectors represent arrows and are important for describing simple geometrical objects in a three dimensional space, such as lines, planes, or spheres. This in turn can be used to calculate shadows and reflections.

In physics, vectors are used to describe fundamental properties such as speed or force, or anything else that can be described by a direction and a value. 

Interestingly, the concept of vectors can be applied to spaces of any dimensions, not just three. Statistics or Fourieranalysis, for example, make use of such concepts.
