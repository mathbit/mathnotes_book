Vectors represent arrows and are important for describing simple geometrical objects in a three dimensional space, such as lines, planes, or spheres. This in turn can be used to calculate shadows and reflections for photo-realistic sceneries in games and the like ("ray tracing").

In physics, vectors are used to describe fundamental properties such as speeds or forces, or anything else whose description requires not only a number, but also a direction.

Interestingly, the concept of vectors can be applied to spaces of any dimension, not just three. Statistics and Fourieranalysis, for example, make use of such concepts.
